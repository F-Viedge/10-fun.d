      <h1>Art Collecting &amp; Selling</h1>

    <div class="summary">
     <p> I am Frederick Viedge. I&apos;m using this opportunity to build a site as part of an online coding course to talk about my dreams around art.  I dream of an international art fun.d. </p>

     <p>Who knows what will happen but in the meantime I make art to celebrate or commemorate friends and family.</p>  
      
     <p>You can see them below - and although the purpose of this exercise is a website for a social club I am accepting commissions (winky face).
     </p>
      
     <p>But keeping with the spirit of the exercise if you&apos;re an artist in Johannesburg and are interested in meeting up, talking about your art and maybe even giving me some unwanted pieces to sell, I would be happy to do so...</p>
      
     <p>My model is and will always be 10 ZAR holding fee and a 10% markup.</p>
      
     <p>Art is and will always be a mechanism to generate wealth - hence I&apos;ve included my ideas around using track art to make an artist a millionaire with an international track art competition.
    </p>
      
    <p>Art is also an investment tool, so I&apos;m tieing trading in art as part of trading markets to keep growing the profits of the fun.d.  I&apos;m also open to talking about trading in a non douchebag scammy...Let&apos;s see.
    </p>
      
     <p>Thanks for visiting this site I&apos;ve left links to videos on some of the images for you to go down a deeper rabbit hole...if you so choose to do so...</p>
      
     <p>Otherwise the instagram page for 10 fun.d is where I interact with art and lovers from all over the world...</p>
      
     <p>Ahh the magic of the internet.</p>
